# 🧠 Neon Cortex

**Independent AI research from Australia, focused on cognitive architectures and embodied intelligence.**

Currently exploring equilibrium-based world models for sequential decision making, combining Energy-Based Models with transformer architectures for adaptive, planful AI agents.

## 🔬 Research Focus

- **Equilibrium World Models**: Novel architecture using Equilibrium Matching (EqM) for joint state-action prediction
- **Cognitive Architectures**: Building agents that reason, plan, and adapt
- **Embodied Intelligence**: From game-playing to robotics and real-world tasks

## 🎯 Current Work

### Snake World Models (2025)
Implementing EqM-based world models that learn energy landscapes over state-action spaces. Instead of fixed-horizon integration like diffusion models, we use gradient descent to find optimal next states and actions simultaneously.

**Key Innovation**: Joint optimization of state and action in a learned energy landscape conditioned on current state, enabling adaptive compute and natural planning behavior.

**Applications**: 
- Sequential decision making (Snake, games)
- ARC-AGI challenges
- Robotics and embodied tasks
